[ChatClient]

The ChatClient Application is a simple Java Application, for communication between users on different devices. Using this application users can send and
receive messages to and from the Server. There will be a Server which will accept connections by listening on one of its ports. Once a client connects,
it will be able to communicate with Server as well as other users. In this simple version all messages will be broadcasted to Server as well as other users.

Java is the primary tool used. Java sockets is used for connections, while swing is used for interface. In case of multiple clients, each of the client 
connections is put on different threads which are synchronized. An arraylist is maintained for recording client information.

Basic working : 

First of all, the Server is started, which listens on a specified port, waiting for a client to connect. Then client logs into the Server, giving its name.
The client can now send messages to the server and receive messages from it too. Other clients connecting also have the same functionalities. Clients can logout
or ask for all connected client names anytime during their connection with the Server.
Any of the Client-Server connection terminates if either of them terminates. While all connections end once the Server shuts down.
